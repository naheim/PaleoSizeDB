## The Database

The PaleoSize Database is an archive of body sizes for fossil marine animals--including quite a few genera whose range extends to the Recent. We currently focus on solitariy marine taxa from the following phyla: Arthropoda, Brachiopoda, Chordata, Echinodermata, and Mollusca. We also have sizes for benthic foraminifera. 

## The Data Files

Currently, we have two data files available in this repository. The first, *genera_range_through.txt* is a file with the total stratigraphic range, body size, and functional ecological mode for Phanerozoic marine genera. The second, *species_sizes.txt*, is compilation of species-level body sizes for species of marine animals and benthic foraminifera.
